* Change action by system environment
  =separate= provide function that help you to separate setting
  by system environment, such as system-name given by =(system-name)=,
  Emacs version, OS, and so on.
* How to Use?
  Set your definition of separator into =separate-separator-alist= (optional),
  and use =separate-setq= or =separate-cond=.
  See also [[Separator][Separator Section]] and [[Keywords][Keywords Section]].

* Separator
  - =separator= means object which can separate system environment.
  - =separator= can be list, symbol, number or string.
** List
   - There are 2 types of listed-separator.
   - One type is:
     - Have keyword in the =car=. All keywords start ":".
     - =cdr= of the list is argument. See [[Keywords][Keywords Section]].
   - The other type is:
     - Don't have keyword in the =car=. This is put =:separators= keyword
       automatically. See [[=:separators= / =:alias= / =:or=][:separator Section]].
** Symbol
   - This is interpreted as =separator= defined in =separate-separator-alist=,
   or system-type (same as =:os= keyword). See [[=separate-separator-alist=][separate-separator-alist Section]].
   - the symbol =default= is special symbol. Element including this is evaluated
     only when all of other =seprators= are invalid.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n
  ;;Define symbol separator.
  (setq separate-separator-alist
   '(
     ;; This separator means "if `system-name' is "my-windows",".

     ;; if `system-name' is "MY-PC,". See also String Section and
     ;; :and Section.

** Number
   This is interpreted as has =:emacs-version>== keyword.
   See [[=:emacs-version>==][:emacs-version>= Section]].
** String
   This is interpreted as has =:system-name= keyword.
   See [[=:system-name=][:system-name Section]].
* Keywords
** =:system-name=
   - This keyword accept multiple argument of =string=. if at least one of
     argument is same as system-name, this =separator= is valid.
   - Keyword =:system-name= is optional.

#+END_SRC
** =:emacs-version>==
   - This keyword accept 1 or 2 argument(s) of number. First argument is =M=,
     and second argument (optional) is =m=. If emacs version is same or higher
     than =M.m=, this =separator= is valid.
   - If you use only first argument, you can write number of major-version as separator.

* Variables
** =separate-separator-alist=
   - An associated list. Each element is cons cell,
     =(symbol . separator)=. In this package, you can use the =symbol=
     as the =separator=.
   - See also [[How to Use?][How to Use Section]]
   - In the future, we will provide some functions to define =symbol-separator=
     like this.
* Macros
** =separate-set (variable alist)=
   - Set value of =VARIABLE= depend on =SEPARATOR= below.
   - Each element of =ALIST= is =(SEPARATOR . VALUE)=,
     and =VARIABLE= is set to =VALUE=
     if =SEPARATOR= is valid.
   - If there are some cons cells whose car (= =SEPARATOR=) is valid,
     upstream element is used, and rest of them is not evaluated.
   - in the cons cell whose =SEPARATOR= is =default=,
     its =VALUE= is used only when any other =SEPARATOR= isn't valid.
   - =(separate-set 'a ((b . c) ...))= is absolutely same as
     =(separate-setq a ((b . c) ...))=.
** =separate-setq (variable alist)=
   - Same as =separate-set=, but =VARIABLE= doesn't have to be quoted.
   - See [[How to Use?][How to Use Section]] as example.
** =separate-set-no-eval (variable alist)=
   - Same as =separate-set-no-eval=, but =VALUE= are NOT evalueted.
** =separate-setq-no-eval (variable alist)=
   - Same as =separate-setq-no-eval=, but =VALUE= are NOT evalueted.
** =separate-cond (&body clauses)=
   - Similar to =cond=, but use =SEPARATOR= instead of =CANDICATE=.
     If =SEPARATOR= is valid, evaluate =BODY=.
   - Priority of each clause is same as =separate-set=.
